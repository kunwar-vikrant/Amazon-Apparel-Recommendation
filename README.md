35% of Amazon.com’s revenue is generated by its recommendation engine. So what’s their strategy?

Judging by Amazon’s success, the recommendation system works. The company reported a 29% sales increase to $12.83 billion during its second fiscal quarter, up from $9.9 billion during the same time last year. A lot of that growth arguably has to do with the way Amazon has integrated recommendations into nearly every part of the purchasing process

+ Clicking on the “Your Recommendations” link on Amazon.com leads users to a page full of products recommended just for you. Amazon recommends a range of products from different categories you’ve been browsing, with the aim of putting products in front of you that you’re likely to click, learn more about and buy.

+ This recommendation has one main goal: increase average order value. ‘Frequently bought together’ recommendations aim to up-sell and cross-sell customers by providing product suggestions based on the items in their shopping cart or below products they’re currently looking at on-site.

+ Amazon looks at products you’ve been browsing and recommends very similar products of different shapes, sizes and brands to help you find something very similar to a product you’ve already shown an interest in. They throw different brands, colours, shapes and sizes at you with the hope that they’ll place one product in front of you that you cannot resist.

+ If you’ve already looked at a product, it means you were slightly interested and Amazon knows it, so they’ll show you your browsing history in case you want to quickly go back and buy something you previously showed an interest in.

There are in-depth discussions about how Amazon’s recommendations engine works.

Existing recommendation algorithms couldn’t scale to Amazon’s tens of millions of customers and products, so they decided to develop their own.

Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time.

This type of filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user.

Their recommendation algorithm is an effective way of creating a personalized shopping experience for each customer which helps Amazon increase average order value and the amount of revenue generated from each customer.


## Problem Statement
- To recommend items based on user's interests with high accuracy.

## ML Models
